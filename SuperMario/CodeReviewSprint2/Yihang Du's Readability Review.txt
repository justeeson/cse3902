Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
	Readable: The three function is really easy to understand, each lines within the functions is easy to understand. The naming for each variable in the function is stright forward.
	Non-Readable: The naming for these two files are too similar, people are not able to identify which file represent which blocks. It should be renamed to hidden brick, Nonbreakable brick, etc..
