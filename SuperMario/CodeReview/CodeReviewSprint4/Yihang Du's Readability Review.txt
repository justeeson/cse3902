Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: This method is used for checking the key pressed and
then move the mario to the next position. This code is not easy to read, there are a lot of nested if loop
in this class. This make the code hard to read and maintains, especially in the update method, this method
is doing multiple things at the same time. The draw method is clean and easy to understand.
