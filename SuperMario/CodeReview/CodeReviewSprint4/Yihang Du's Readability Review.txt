Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The method is really easy to understand, the author
used for each to make the code more clean, and easy to read. For each different object, it will check differet
object types and use different collision handling class to handle different collision. It is a little bit hard 
to read when he is using all the same name item in for each loop.
