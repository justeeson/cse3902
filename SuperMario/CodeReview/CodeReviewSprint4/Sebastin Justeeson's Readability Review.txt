SpriteFactory.cs Code Author: Son Le
 
The code is really long but this is necessary in order for the class to perform its function properly. The code
is easy to understand at a glance since there are no complex functions and the code only consists of one line
assignments. The function names and the variable names used also immediately let the reader know what is going on. 
Overall, this code file is very easily readable and there isn't much room for improvement.
