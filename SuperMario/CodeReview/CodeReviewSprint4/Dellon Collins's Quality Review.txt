The class holds all properties of object flower. It performs its tasks like drawing, update, and respond to
collision. Thus, the class has high cohesion inside itself. Also, the class has low coupling since it only uses 
internal variables which a few interferes with other classes if we just compare those varibles within the class.
This class has good design. It allows us to update any features to the game easily and add other properties to
the class if necessary in the future.
