Specific comments on code quality: This is a very short class and is extremely easy to understand. The cohesion is quite high
since all the member variables and functions are directly relevant to what the camera class aims to do. The variables have 
also been named very aptly and their intent is immediately clear. The cyclomatic complexity is quite low as there are only a 
bunch of if statements.

One hypothetical change that could be made in order to improve the code is to use constant variables instead of utilizing
magic numbers. These magic numbers make the code slightly harder to understand for an outside reviewer who may not immediately
understand why those specific numbers have been chosen. For example, instead of using the number 6350 directly, a constant 
variable named 'EndOfLevel' could have been used. This would make the code easier to maintain and extend for others classes.
This would also improve the readability.
