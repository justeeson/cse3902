Code is easy to understand because of the name convention. By reading the name of variables and names of methods,
we can definitely tell what type of variables or what variables we are using. Other than that, the structure of nested
if statements is also easy to understand by comparing the side of the mario rectangle with collision rectangle from bottom to top
and from left to right, so we can identify what kind of collision it is.
