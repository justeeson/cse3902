The code has many dependent variables which other classes are using them such as collections of items,
blocks, enemies, camera and mario. However, there is no way around it to loosen the coupling of this class
because this is the main class that is in touch with other object classes so that we can manipulate and controll
our objects of the game. This class enable us to set up objects with specications from the XML provided and then
creates objects in other classes. Thus, thats why we see many global variables which are acessed by other classes
here. Other than that, I'd say this class has high cohesion because it does only some tasks for specific objects
of the game.
