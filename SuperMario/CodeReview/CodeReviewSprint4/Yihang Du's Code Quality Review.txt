Specific comments on code quality: This is a long class, it is not hard to understand. However, the cyclomatic complexity is high. It used a lot of if else
statements, and there are three if statement nested together. This will make code become harder to maintain. In fact some of the function or vaiable is not
being used at this point, so it is possible to shorten this class for less than 100 lines of code.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we try to change the fireball's speed, we could easily change the Velocity and Acceleration to the value we want. In another case, if we want to change 
the side of the fireball, we could change the size of the destination rectangle where it being drawed.
