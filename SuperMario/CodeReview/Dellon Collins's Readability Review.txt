Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: In this class, many variable used good name, it is easy to understand. Some of the function name is hard to understand, for example CreateSolidBrickWithCrews there are three different functions and the only different is 1, 2, 3, so it is hard to figure out what are those representing.
