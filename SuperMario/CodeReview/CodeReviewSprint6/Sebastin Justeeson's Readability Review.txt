This class is fairly hard to read since it is very long and there are various enums and arrays declared here. The constants in
the Orientations and MarioModes enums have been named appropriately and it is very easy to understand the purpose of these
2 structures. The constructor has a big code block where an array is being initialized. This makes the code less readable
since this block is big and the purpose of this array is not immediately clear. The state array could instead have been
moved to the utility class and then accessed from here in order to make the code more readable. The other functions are all
fairly similar in structure: short body, a few comparisons and they return a result. Even with all the comparisons and logical
statements, the readability is not sacrificed.
