Name of the .cs file being reviewed: FlagPoleClass.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Son Le
Specific comments on code quality: This is a short class, it is very easy to understand. The cyclomatic complexity is low. It did not use any conditional
statements, nor loops. Each method is easy to understand. In BecomeUsed Method, it set mario to the successful state, generate the next level, load mario to
the next level after 4 seconds delay, which will allow mario to have victory animation. In the Update and draw method, it just to update the flagpole and draw
flagpoles.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we want to change the behavior after mario touch the flagpole, we can easily to change the BecomeUsed method. We might need a new class, then after mario
win (touch the flag), we can call that method to assign mario different behavior.
