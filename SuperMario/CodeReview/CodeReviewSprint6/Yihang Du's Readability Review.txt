Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: This class is used for Mario and Blocks collision handling.
This class used a lot of if else statement, however it is not hard to understand. The naming for each method and
parameter is clear and easy to understand. It is easy to understand what it does and how it works. In the last method,
it used to write the collision to the log, which is straight forward to see what information he want to write to
the log files and where to store it.
