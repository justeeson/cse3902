This class has too many lines of code which is a common code smell. Naming conventions have been followed closely which add
to the readability of the code. The class has high cohesion since all the methods and properties are directly relevant to
what the class is trying to achieve - store the various states of mario and provide a way to easily transition between the 
differnet states. The state array creates new objects of every state class and stores them. This drives up coupling since
objects of external classes are being created. However, outside the constructor, coupling is minimum since there are no 
references to any external methods or properties. The cyclomatic complexity of the code is medium since there are a bunch
of if and if-else statements in the various methods. These are however, necessary for the proper functioning of the class.
