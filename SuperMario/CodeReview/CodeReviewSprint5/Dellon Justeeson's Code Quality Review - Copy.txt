Class does basic tasks for a block type which is flag pole. So the cohesion is strong. And it's quite fair
coupling because the class use variables from other classes however it's necessary because the class
needs those variables to be able to operate and manipulate on the date or function correctly. All in all,
the class looks good in term of code metrics like complexity, cohesion, coupling and number lines of code.
