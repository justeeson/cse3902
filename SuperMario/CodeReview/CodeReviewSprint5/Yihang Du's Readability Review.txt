Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: This method is used for HUD display, when user is playing
the game, it will show the statistic of the player. This file used a lot of nested loop, especially in formating
and Update. Although it contain many nested loop, it is not so hard to understand what he is trying to do. Overall,
it is pretty easy to read and understand the code, but it is not easy to understand how the formating work exactly.
