Specific comments on code quality: This is a long class, it is not hard to understand. However, the cyclomatic complexity is high. It used a lot of if else
statements, and there are three if statement nested together. It used in the FOrmatString method, this method is straight forward to understand. In drawing
method it used a lot of if else statement, it could be replaced with switch case statement.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we want to display how many life does mario have, we can easy update the field and bring the variable to the display. Since we already have variable about
mario's life, so we could display it easily.
