Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Game1.cs

Game1 has alot of dependencies and many classes would access to these fields or properties in the Game1 class. this make
the class become tight coupling, but this is the way it is, so we can understand why many other classes have to acccess
these variables in the Game1 class. This is because Game1 class is the central of the application. Similarly, the class is ok with
cohesion because it's the tasks or methods which are necessary for the game to be able to run. The number of code may be alittle much,
we can move some of them to somewhere else. thats my suggestion.
