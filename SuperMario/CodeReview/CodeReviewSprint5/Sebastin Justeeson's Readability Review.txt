This class defines the underground level for the mario game. The variables are fairly straightforward with their naming. It is easy to
see what is going on in the constructor as it is basically just initializing each relevant variable. The reset, draw and update functions
are also easy to read as they are straightforward without any nesting. However, the various add functions seem to clutter up the code. It
would be better if instead of multiple small functions, the code was contained within one function by utilizing switch-case statements
within.
