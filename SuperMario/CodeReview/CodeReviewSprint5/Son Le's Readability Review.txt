This is the core class of the game. It has many fields, properties and a few methods but they are readable because
the way the author named them. the name are meanningful so that the class rarely has any comments. The impletation of 
methods provoked inside the class are written somewhere else so this reduce the complexity of the methods body inside
the class. However, since this class has many connections with other classes through out the applications, there are alot
of fields and methods needed to be reviewed.
