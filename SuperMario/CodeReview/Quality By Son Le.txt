Name of the .cs file being reviewed: MarioBecomeSmallCommand.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Yihang
Specific comments on code quality: Quality of code is good. We can easily manage code and maintenance code
The code is simple with a few variables and methods. The class is implementing all methods in the interface.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed 
and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
In the future, we may need to add more functions to the interface. We can easily implement those functions here
because we have access to variable game1 of class Game1. We also can add more methods in the this class if needed.
