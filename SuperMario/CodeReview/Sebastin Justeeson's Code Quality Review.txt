KeyboardController.cs

The number of lines in the code is quite appropriate given the task that the controller is meant to perform. The class
has high cohesion because all the variables and methods are together meant to perform the single task of handling the 
key presses on the keyboard. The class has low coupling since it only refers to a variable in another class once. The 
cyclomatic complexity of the code is only 5 and thus there aren't any unnecessary additional flows. 
One change that could be made to the code is to make it use a method from a class or declare an object of the class directly
within the code instead of calling an object from the Game1 class. This would also make it more maintainable as now changes
made in the Game1 class will never affect the logic for determining the set of valid keys. The controller code can easily
be changed to accommodate this change by either declaring the object directly within the KeyboardController.cs file or
changing the logic of the validKeys class.
