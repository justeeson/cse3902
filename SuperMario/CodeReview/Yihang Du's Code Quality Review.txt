Specific comments on code quality: This is a long class, but the method is not a lot. We used this file to create 2D texture for each sprites, load the 
texture to the content, and then create a ISprite of that types. The code is easy to understand and easy to maintaince, everything is easy to find and 
we could modify the sprites quickly. This class create a lot of convenience for us to change the loaded contents.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
It will quite wasy to add the new sprites to the game by just adding new 2D texture, then create the sprite in this class. Then we can create a new class
to draw that class. If we would like to change the picture for the sprites, we could just mondify the sprites in this class, instead of finding it from 
entire solution.
