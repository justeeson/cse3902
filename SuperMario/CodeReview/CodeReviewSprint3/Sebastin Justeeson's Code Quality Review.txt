The code is well written and easily readable and maintainable. The cyclomatic complexity is also quite low
as it only uses minimal number of block statements. Code file has high cohesion as all functions are directly 
related to the mushroom object - drawing it, handling collision and updating its animation. The code has
moderate amount of coupling as it declares 3 public variables and also uses a public static variable
directly from the Mario class.
