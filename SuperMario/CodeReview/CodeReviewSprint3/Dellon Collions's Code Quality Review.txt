The class controls the camera that follows the player. The class has high cohesion inside itself since its only function
is scroll the camera along with the player. The class is coupled with every game object since the sprites have to be drawn
relative to the camera, but this is necessary for the game to work. We could make the camera position fields static 
(or non-static for multiple types of cameras) so that other classes can't inadvertently change the camera position. 
Overall well written with no extra functionality; This class has good design.
