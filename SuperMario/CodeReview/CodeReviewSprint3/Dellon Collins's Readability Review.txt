MarioClass/Mario.cs Code Author: Sebastin Justeeson

Mario.StarPowerUp is a misnomer as it just toggles Mario's star power status. And the code does not make this 
clear immediately either. Its body could be replaced with 

starStatus = !starStatus;

to make it more obvious. Mario.Update is readable though. It is obvious that the method controls the duration 
of star and invulnerability status.
