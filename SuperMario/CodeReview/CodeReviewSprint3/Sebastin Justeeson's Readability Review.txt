Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The code has been nicely split into several small functions
which make the code really easy to read and to understand the logic. The variable names are suitable as they immediately
tell the reader what purpose they serve in the code. The logic of the Draw() function was however, a little hard
to understand at first since it was confusing as to why the program would need to throw an exception.
