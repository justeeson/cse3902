Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: The code is simple to understand with basic mathematical
algorithm to determine where the blocks lie compare to Mario. It's easy to understand the code because the argorithm
is simple and name of variables which make the code not needed to have comments. The code help the reader to understand
the positions of the 2 objects then they can know what actions may be performed according to each coresponding position.
