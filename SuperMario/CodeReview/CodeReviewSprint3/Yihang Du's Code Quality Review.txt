Specific comments on code quality: This is a long class, it is not so easy to understand. However, the cyclomatic complexity is high. It used a lot of if else
statements, and many of them are nested together. This will make code become harder to maintain. One of the solution is to used switch case with if else, in 
order to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the code and will make the code easier to maintain.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we decided to create life count for mario, it will be not so easy to modify this class. In this class, we set the mario will alway transfer from fire 
to big then to small. It will require a lot of changes in order to make it functions with life count. It is also not so easy to change if mario is collision
with multiple objects.
