Specific comments on code quality: The class is simple to understand with simple methods which do their own jobs.
There are two methods which are doing two tasks are drawing and update based on gameTime. The class has high cohesion
because it does only 2 jobs. The class has medium coupling because it's using a few globla variables which are passing
to it. But it the only way to update functions in the class, so it's worth it to keep it that way
