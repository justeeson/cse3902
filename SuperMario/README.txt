Note: 
	For CA1502, there was no elegant solution since the class is adding every single type of object and there is no way to skip
	this task. For CA1814, the warning was left unchecked because the array is of a small and fixed size and thus memory is not
	a concern. CA1819 was not fixed since the array implementation was essential to how the variables were used elsewhere in the 
	code. Fixing this warning would have taken too much time for little benefit and thus the warning was overlooked for now.
