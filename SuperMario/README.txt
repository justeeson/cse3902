Note: 
	There are alot of warnings with similarities. There are similar warning repeated in the same class because the
	compiler thinks we didn't use those fields, but in fact, we use them somewhere else. That's the only way to implement 
	those because for instance, sprite factory is where we create new objects, we dont use those objects in there. we use them
	somewhere else because that's the purpose of sprite factory which make senses so we ignore those warnings.
