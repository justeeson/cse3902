Sprint 6 - Burndown Chart Assessment

For this sprint, the team was finally able to move at a much better pace compared to the previous sprints. By 
analyzing the burndown chart, it is seen that the total amount of work done steadily decreased over the allocated
time period for the Sprint. The small spikes were due to additional work being added as tasks which were overlooked
during the initial planning period. some of team memebers started and finished a vast majority of their tasks 3-4 days
before the due which is really good. They may have time to fix some minor bugs before the due day. Some of team
members still work their tasks several hours before the due date. These two facts mentions above balanced out the
burn down chart. However, since many of the tasks are finished early we can see a decrease in the trend of the burn
downchart during the last two days of the project.

The work is split between each member of the team. Each member picks their own tasks to work on this project.
We already asked for advise from the professor and made sure that the tasks which each team member working on
were not too little. In general, some team members like to spend time on this project which make them have more
features than the others. This far beyond meets the requirements for this project but also indicates those
teammemers in contribution to this game project.
