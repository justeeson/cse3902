By analyzing the burndown chart for this sprint, it is clear that the amount of workremaining was almost always above 
the recommended line. This was because of a few major bugs that were extremely hard to detect at first. However, after 
meeting with the professor and having discussions with each other, these bugs were spotted and fixed during the week leading 
up to the deadline for the refactored implementation. The biggest time sink was implementing the level reader using XML. 
After a lot of review, the team finally got the reader to work. After this, designing the rest of the level took very little
time.

However, the amount of work remaining did not drop much because new features were constantly being added and new bugs kept 
arising leading up to the deadline. Even though the team took careful precautions to avoid the mistakes made during the
previous sprints, the scope of this sprint was underestimated by the team as it was larger and more difficult than the others.
