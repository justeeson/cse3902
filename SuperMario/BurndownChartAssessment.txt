Sprint 5 - Burndown Chart Assessment

For this sprint, the team was finally able to move at a much better pace compared to the previous sprints. By 
analyzing the burndown chart, it is seen that the total amount of work done steadily decreased over the allocated
time period for the Sprint. The small spikes were due to additional work being added as tasks which were overlooked
during the initial planning period. However, compared to previous sprints, the magnitude of this error was very 
small this time around. This was mostly due to the team reaziling the mistakes made from the previous sprints
and making a conscious effort to avoid it this time around by discussing with each other as well as clarifying all
doubts with the professor before working on the code. 

The work was also split up better this time around. Different group members were allotted work based on what they
had previously worked on as well as what they were interested in. However, due to plenty of code analysis warnings,
code smells and bugs, the team was unable to bring the remaining work under the target line. Therefore, in the 
future the team will also assign some time for such tasks which are not directly relevant to the implementation.
Even with all the issues, this sprint was the one that the team had the most control over and came closest to
developing a perfect solution for.
